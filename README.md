# ToDoApp

The intention of this project is to continue learning about WebPack, build it out best as can following DRY and SOLID principles. The goal is to build an app that uses loosely coupled code.

First will be to use the RDD, or Readme Driven Development.

Clearly define what the functions are, break them down as necessary.

Build app logic separately from the DOM
